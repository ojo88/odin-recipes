    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This dish is one of the reasons I have to go on a low carb diet. There is not a name for this dish, but the recipe is from a popular Youtube cooking channel (Not Another Cooking Show). The Youtuber based the sauce from a dish he had in his teenage years while visiting family in Italy. I call the dish Red Pepper Sauce with Cavatappi and it's so delicious and easy to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A jar of calabrian peppers</li>
        <li>1 pint of heavy cream</li>
        <li>Crushed red peppers</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>Pecorino romano</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
        <li>16 oz of cavatappi/cellentani</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pan on the stove at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop red bell peppers, onions and garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, add the peppers, onions and garlic to the pan and saute.</li>
        <li>After 3 minutes or when the onions and peppers appear almost done, mix in  two spoonfuls of calabrian peppers.</li>
        <li> Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and saute for a bit.</li>
        <li>After 3 or 4 minutes add a pint of heavy cream to the pan and stir sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook for 3 or 4 more minutes and then remove the pan from the stove.</li>
        <li>While hot, add the sauce to a blender and blend until it's a nice smooth consistency. The sauce is now ready and can be placed in a container to store for future use if desired.</li>
        <li>The stove should still be hot so place a pot of salted water on the stove to cook the cavatappi pasta. Cook the pasta for 1 or 2 minutes less than the recommended cooking time on box. We're going to finish cooking the cavatappi in the pasta sauce pan.</li>
        <li>While the cavatappi pasta is boiling in the pot, take this time to grate 1/3 of a cup of pecorino romano and set aside.</li>
        <li></li>
