    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This dish is one of the reasons I have to go on a low carb diet. There is not a name for this dish, but the recipe is from a popular Youtube cooking channel (Not Another Cooking Show). The Youtuber based the sauce from a dish he had in his teenage years while visiting family in Italy. I call the dish Red Pepper Sauce with Cavatappi and it's so delicious and easy to make.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A jar of calabrian peppers</li>
        <li>1 pint of heavy cream</li>
        <li>Crushed red peppers</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>Pecorino romano</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
        <li>16 oz of cavatappi/cellentani</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pan on the stove at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop red bell peppers, onions and garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.</li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, add the peppers, onions and garlic to the pan and saute.</li>
        <li>After 3 minutes or when the onions and peppers appear almost done, mix in  two spoonfuls of calabrian peppers.</li>
        <li> Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and saute for a bit.</li>
        <li>After 3 or 4 minutes add a pint of heavy cream to the pan and stir sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook for 3 or 4 more minutes and then remove the pan from the stove.</li>
        <li>While hot, add the sauce to a blender and blend until it's a nice smooth consistency. The sauce is now ready and can be placed in a container to store for future use if desired.</li>
        <li>The stove should still be hot so place a pot of salted water on the stove to cook the cavatappi pasta. You don't have to cook all the pasta so just put enough water to the pot to cook your serving of the dish.</li>
        <li>While the water is heating in the pot, take this time to grate 1/3 of a cup of pecorino romano and set aside.</li>
        <li>When the pot is boiling, add in the cavatappi. We want to cook the pasta for 1 or 2 minutes less than the recommended cooking time on box. We're going to finish cooking the cavatappi in the pasta sauce pan.</li>
        <li>Heat up another stove to medium heat and place the pasta sauce pan on top.</li>
        <li>When the pan heats up, place a tablespoon of butter in the pan and coat the surface.</li>
        <li>There should be a few minutes until the cavatappi needs to be removed from the pot so we're going to prepare the sauce to finish the cook. Add and equivalent amount of pasta sauce to the pan to pair with the cavatappi. Lift and stir so the the sauce doesn't burn. </li>
        <li>When the cavatappi is about 1 or 2 minutes away from the recommended cooking time, remove the cavatappi from the pot with a pasta server and add to the pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of pasta water to the pan and stir in well.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2 minutes while lifting the pan off the stove to add some grate pecorino to the pan and mix well. Add a little bit more of pasta sauce and your dish is ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
