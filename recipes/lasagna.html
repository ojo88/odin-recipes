        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is a weekly favorite in my home. The thing that's great about lasagna soup is that it has all the great flavors from a traditional lasagna (a rich bolognese-esque meat sauce and delicious cheese) and it can be made in under 30 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb of Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1/2 lb of ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
            <li>24 oz jar of Rao's Marinara</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Parmesan reggiano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup of chicken broth</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>8 oz of lasagna</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pan or pot on the stove at medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of olive oil to the hot pan and then mix in the chopped onions</li>
            <li>After the onions saute for a 2 minutes, add in the chopped garlic and mix for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add both the Italian sausage and ground beef and mix until browned. Use a potato masher to get the meat to a nice bite size and consistency</li>
            <li>Add the 2 tbsp of tomato paste to the meat and mix in evenly. Saute for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the jar of Rao's Marinara sauce to the pan and then stir.</li>
            <li>Season the pan with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes of sauteing, add in the heavy cream and stir until it is evenly distributed in the sauce. The sauce should change color from red to orange.</li>
            <li>Add the cup of chicken broth to the sauce and stir.</li>
            <li>Break the lasagna sheets into smaller pieces and drop them into the tomato sauce. Mix pasta into the sauce to ensure the sheets are covered in sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook until the pasta has softened to the desirable bite. You may need to add water to the sauce if it becomes to thick before the pasta is completely cooked</li>
            <li>When the pasta is cooked to the desired bite, remove the pan from the stove</li>
            <li>Adjust the stove temperature from medium heat to low heat.</li>
            <li>Add in Mozzarella cheese along with grated parmesan reggiano and the fresh basil into the lasagna soup and mix.</li>
            <li>Place the pan back onto the stove and heat a few minutes until the cheese has melted. </li>
        </ol>
